# Eximous Whatsapp Chat Analysis
## Introduction
An analysis of a whatsapp group text data to practise analyzing .txt datasets

## Problem 
These are the questions I would like to derive answers to
Total number of participants on the group, Three most active members in the group?, Three most active members on the group?, Total number of messages in the group from January to March, 2022, 

## Data Collection
Data was collected from whatsapp by opening the WhatsApp group to be analyzed  and clicking on the three dots at the topmost right-hand corner of the app, then click on more, and then export chat. Finally, select without media. The data collected was a .txt file.

## Data Preparation
The data was then exported to excel. However, because it was a .txt file, It needed to be converted to a structured format. This was done using Excel Power Query by transforming the data into rows and columns.

## Data Transformatiom
The data was cleaned by initially unifying the font size. Subsequently, new columns were created and the data was separated into the 'Name', 'Date', 'Day', 'Month', 'Time', and 'Chat' Columns. I ensured the table was devoid of blank cells and errors and screened the data for duplicaates.
