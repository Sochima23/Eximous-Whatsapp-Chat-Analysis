# Eximous Whatsapp Chat Analysis
## Introduction
An analysis of a whatsapp group text data to practise analyzing .txt datasets

## Problem 
These are the questions I would like to derive answers to
Total number of participants on the group, Most active members on the group?, Total number of messages on the group, The most active time of the day and most active days and months

## Data Collection
Data was collected from whatsapp by opening the WhatsApp group to be analyzed and clicking on the three dots at the topmost right-hand corner of the app, then clicking on more. Finally, I exported the chat by selecting without media. The data collected was a .txt file.

## Data Preparation
The data was then exported to excel. However, because it was a .txt file, It needed to be converted to a structured format. This was done using Excel Power Query by transforming the data into rows and columns.

## Data Transformatiom
The data was cleaned by initially creating new columns and the data was separated into the 'Name', 'Date', 'Day', 'Month', 'Time', and 'Chat' Columns. I ensured the table was devoid of blank cells and errors and screened the data for duplicates.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
Power Bi was used for the visualization
